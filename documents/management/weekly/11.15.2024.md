### Team Remarks

- **Yann-Maël BOUTON**:  “ Be more precise on what the game must be. We actually spend more time to find an idea than to develop this idea. ”
- **Lucas MEGNAN**: “ I haven’t made much progress on my functional because we switched our game. As a result, I think I’m currently at 30%. My next task is to write different paragraphs about the structure of my functional, incorporating all the ideas we came up with together. ”
- **Abderrazaq MAKRAN**: “ Since i have already explored godot, I tried to go forward with the idea ”
- **Alexandre BOPP**: “ I didn't really enjoy this past week, as we spent a lot of time trying to find a good idea without making much progress. ”
- **Enoal ADAM**: “ If we stay on our current idea, I will start to write the manual ”
- **Vianney POLARD**: “ Not very constructive in terms of goals ”

> #### **Overall Summary**: We actually spent the whole week trying to come up with an idea. We found one, but it was later rejected multiple time. Now, however, we’ve come up with a game. Unfortunately, this means we have to roll back some tasks, such as the functional and technical aspects.
