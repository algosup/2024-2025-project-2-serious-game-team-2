### 1. **Project Name**
**EcoSphere: Climate Change Awareness**

---

### 2. **Project Description**
EcoSphere is a serious game that simulates various scenarios related to climate change, allowing players to make strategic decisions to mitigate its effects. Through interactive missions and educational activities where players' choices directly influence the progression of the game, they will learn about the causes, consequences, and potential solutions to climate change.

---

### 3. **Project Objectives**
- Develop a serious game focused on climate change.
- Utilize the Godot Engine for game development.
- Program the game entirely in GDScript.
- Create an engaging and educational tool to raise awareness about climate change.

### 4. **Project Scope**

#### **In Scope**

1. **Game Development**
    - Develop a **serious game** that simulates geopolitical and ecological decision-making focused on climate change.
    - Include a **zoomable planisphere** with real-time indicators of ecological, economic, and geopolitical states.
    - Implement gameplay mechanics for:
        - Creating and updating **legal restrictions** to influence industries.
        - Modifying or destructing industrial activities to reduce environmental impact.
        - Investing in **research and development** at country, continent, or global levels.

2. **Realistic Simulation**
    - Ensure actions and their consequences unfold over time, reflecting **real-world dynamics**.
    - Incorporate **realistic representations** of ecological and political challenges without oversimplified mechanics.

3. **Educational Features**
    - Provide **real-time feedback** to players, showing the outcomes of their decisions, such as:
        - Changes in global temperature.
        - Improved or degraded ecosystems.
        - Economic and political ripple effects.
    - Teach players about the interconnectedness of environmental, political, and industrial systems.

4. **Technical Details**
    - Use the **Godot Engine** for development.
    - Program the game entirely in **GDScript**.
    - Ensure immersive gameplay with **2D graphics**, and a **clear focus on educational goals**.

5. **Delivery**
    - Deliver a **playable prototype** game that demonstrates the full scope of features mentioned above.

#### **Out of Scope**

1. **Commercial Release**
    - The game will not be published for commercial purposes.
    - No marketing, distribution, or monetization activities will be undertaken.

2. **Multiplayer or Complex Online Features**
    - The game will not include multiplayer components or large-scale online connectivity.

3. **Expansions Beyond Initial Scope**
    - The scope is limited to the specified gameplay features and will not include expansions such as:
