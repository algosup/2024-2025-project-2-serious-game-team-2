# Functional Requirements

## Serious Game Overview

### Theme
---

The game, Ecosphere, immerses players in a global crisis scenario, challenging them to address and mitigate the devastating impacts of climate change. Acting as decision-makers, players will navigate the complex interplay of **economy, politics, and environmental sustainability**, learning firsthand the difficulties of implementing effective climate solutions in the real world.

Players will take on the responsibility of:

- **Passing laws** to regulate industries and reduce environmental harm.
- **Investing in research and green technologies** to drive sustainable development.
- **Managing geopolitical challenges while balancing** national and global interests.

Every action triggers consequences: cutting emissions could improve environmental health but at the expense of economic growth, while prioritizing economic activity might accelerate ecological decline. Real-time feedback, such as visualized data on rising temperatures, fluctuating COâ levels, and recovering ecosystems, helps players see the tangible outcomes of their decisions.

This simulation teaches that solving climate challenges requires strategic thinking, collaboration, and long-term commitment, showing how even incremental changes can lead to meaningful impacts.

### Game objectives
---

**1.** **Educate and Engage**: Help players understand the interconnectedness of economic, environmental, and political systems in the context of climate change.

**2.** **Encourage Strategic Thinking**: Challenge players to develop thoughtful strategies that balance short-term and long-term goals.

**3.** **Raise Awareness**: Provide an immersive experience that highlights the complexities and urgency of global climate action.

**4.** **Foster Actionable Knowledge**: Equip players with insights into real-world climate solutions, inspiring them to advocate for or implement sustainable practices in their lives.

### Player Goals
---

**1. Reverse Climate Change**: Take decisive actions to reduce global carbon emissions, halt deforestation, and curb environmental degradation.

**2. Achieve Sustainability**: Balance ecological, economic, and social factors to create a stable and thriving global system.

**3. Optimize Resources**: Allocate limited resources efficiently across regions, industries, and technologies to maximize impact.

**4. Maintain Global Stability**: Address geopolitical tensions and social unrest while pursuing environmental goals.

**5. Innovate for the Future**: Invest in and deploy cutting-edge technologies to solve complex climate challenges.

**6. Adapt and Learn**: Respond to emerging crises and evolving scenarios with flexibility and strategic foresight.

Players will need to plan, implement, and adapt their decisions as they strive to create a sustainable future for the planet.

    - **Global Emissions**: Shows current COâ output and how it trends over time.
    - **Planet Health Indicators**: Tracks metrics like global temperature, deforestation rate, and biodiversity index.
  
    **2. Country-Specific Data**:
    - **GDP** (Gross Domestic Product): Indicates a countryâs economic capacity and determines available resources for investments or scientific research.
    - **Scientific Progress Bar**: Visualizes ongoing research activities and their time to completion.
  
    **3. Player Feedback Panel**:
    - Shows the outcomes of player decisions in terms of **ecological, economic, and geopolitical changes**.
    - Critical **alerts** for disasters or urgent matters.

    **4. Map Interaction Menu**:
    - Allows access to national data, laws, industries, and global overlays.

**HUD of the world map:**

![WorldHUD](pictures/WorldMapHUD.png)

**HUD of a country map:**

![CountryHUD](pictures/CountryMapHUD.png)

#### 2. Mechanics
---

- The HUD dynamically updates based on player actions and global events:
  - **Funds and GDP**:
    - **GDP** grows or shrinks depending on the nation's policies and industrial activities.
    - Allocate a percentage of GDP to **scientific research** for technological advancements or sustainable solutions.
  - **Scientific Research System**:
    - Players can fund scientists to research **new technologies** or **climate solutions**.
    - Completed research unlocks tools like **renewable energy technologies**, **carbon capture systems**, or **drought-resistant crops**.
    - Research projects require time and are influenced by **funding levels** and **geopolitical stability**.
  - **Planet Health Metrics**:
    - Real-time feedback on environmental trends to help players assess the effectiveness of their strategies.
    - Includes visible consequences like rising sea levels, desertification, or ecosystem restoration.
  - **Alert Notifications**:
    - Warns players of critical issues such as **natural disasters**, **political unrest**, or **scientific breakthroughs**.

**Integration of GDP and Research**

- GDP acts as the **financial backbone**:
  - Players must maintain GDP to fund **research** while minimizing harm to the environment.
  - Excessive industrial expansion may increase GDP temporarily but lead to higher **emissions** and **ecological degradation**.
- The **scientific research system** challenges players to:
  - Prioritize research areas based on current global challenges.
  - Balance short-term GDP sacrifices with long-term sustainability goals.
